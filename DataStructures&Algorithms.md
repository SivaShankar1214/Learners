# DataStructure
- it a way of Storing and organizing data efficiently.
- Data Structures are of two types.
  - Linear Data Structures
    - Static Data Structures(Arrays)
    - Dynamic Data Structures(Queue,Stack,LinkedList)
  - Non-Linear Data Structures
    - Trees
    - Graphs

# Algorithms
- it explains a procedure of steps in solving a particular problem.
- Comparing Algoriths can be Tricky, it should be done independent of Programming language and machine.In order to compare it, we can do by measuring the number of basic operations performed on a function with input size.

## Time Complexity
- The Rate at which the running cost increases as a function of input is called Rate Of Growth.
- Commonly used rate of Growths are:

|Time Complexity| Name|
|-----------------|------|
|1|Constatnt|
|logn|Logarthmic|
|n|Linear|
|nlogn|Linear Logarthmic|
|n^2|Quadratic|
|n^3|Cubic|
|2^n|Exponential|
|n!|Factorial|

- There are 3 Different types of analysing a Algorithm.
- Worst Case(Big-O) 
- Average Case(Theta)
- Best Case(Omega)

-Tips while caliculating the Algorithm.
- Loops generally takes n times.
- Nested Loops takes n*m times


### Auxiliary Space
- it is the extra space taken by the algorithm to run and produce the result other than then input size.
- 
## Space Complexity
- Space Complexity is the total space taken by inputs and the space taken by the algorithm to run and produce the result.
- Space Complexity is to determine the algorithm's efficiency and it can be caliculated by the varaibles and objects used for the algorithm.

~~~
  Space Complexity  = Auxiliary Space + space taken by the input size.
